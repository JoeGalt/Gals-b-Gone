Gals b Gone v. 0.1

This submod changes unit recruitment and a few missions to allow X-Piratez to be played without gals. It is intended to be used with my Alt Start mod to replace the starting
lunatics with non-gal soldiers. 

Specific changes made include the following:

Recruitment via manufacturing:
-Recruit: Castaway produces Assault Clone instead of Lunatic
-Recruit: Young Uber produces Catgirl instead of Hand
-Recruit: Young Uber (Spy Honors) produces Catgirl or Damsel instead of Hand
-Recruit: Freak Gal produces Gnome instead of Freak
-Recruit: Raider Scout produces Catgirl or Lokk instead of Hand
-Recruit: Flame Guard produces Catwarrior with Combat Armor instead of Warrior with Heavy Suit

-Glamour Recruitment allows for several different options:
--Hero with Strongman armor
--Girl Guide with Legion armor
--Catwarrior with Stormcat armor
--Wild Gnome with n9000 outfit

-Human Commandos can be recruited as Pureblood Soldiers with Legion armor
-Humongous Raiders can be recruited as Ogres
-Bloodhounds can be recruited as Bloodhounds

Country Bonuses:
-Turan:
--Recruit: Turanian Gal produces Catwarrior with Camo Paint and a new item that can be used to produce a Bloodhound instead of Warrior with Hyena
---This ugly workaround was necessary because it is impossible for a single manufacturing project to produce multiple soldiers
-Rogue Fields:
--The Technobarbarian event gives a Loader Suit instead of Unplugged Power Armor

Recruitment via the black market:
-Prize: Recruit Freaks allows for purchasing Gnomes instead of Freaks.
-Recruit: Veterans allows for purchasing one Human Hero and one Girl Guide per month
-Ogre monthly hiring limit increased from 1 to 4

Research:
-Superslave research no longer requires Gals are Superior, allowing all paths to access the superhero armors
---Since options are a bit limited without gals, I felt it made sense to allow these regardless of path
-Gals are Superior will be disabled by Diverging Paths and so cannot be researched

Codex-specific:
-Red Codex:
--Aggressor Armor can be exchanged for Strongman, Hound Energy Shield, or Gladiatrix armors

-Green Codex:
--Ex: Stasis Pod (Perfect Gal) produces Gnome or Orge instead of Lunatic
--Zombie Embodiment produces Gnome instead of Freak
--Body Swap transformation can be used on Gnomes and Ogres

-Gold Codex:
--Receives two Admiral outfits instead of one. Each can be exchanged for a Unipuma or Avenger armor. 

-Gray Codex
--Can purchase Damsels from the market after researching Recruit Damsels and crowning
--Can manufacture Disciples of Twilight after researching Glamour Recruitment, Muscle Mages, and Recruit: Bugeyes
--Can manufacture Red Dawn Theurges after researching Glamour Recruitment, Recruit Damsels, and Witch Outfit
---I felt Gray was the big loser, with no good substitute available for gals and no Ascension transformation for the more-available heroes. This is my attempted compensation. 

New manufacturing to exchange some gal-only armors:
-Gal Space Suit can be exchanged for human, catgirl, or lokk space suits
-Plate Mail can be exchanged for Fuso PLate or Lokk Plate Mail

Mission changes:
-X-Prison allows for humans, catgirls, lokks, and gnomes. All will be forced into their nude armor.
-Duel with Dr. X allows for any flying armor
---There was no good solution here. Feel free to Crtl-D + Crtl-J
-A Party! allows for any living non-animal soldier. All will be forced into their default or nude armor.
